    <p>The output value of the count varible is 0 because the line 9 in script.js is getting evaluated only once when we called the function createIncrement() at line 13. Calling function increment() three times (line 14 through 16) updated the value of the count varible in line 2 only. Hence, we are getting value of the count variable as 0 after executing the function log() at line 17.</p>
